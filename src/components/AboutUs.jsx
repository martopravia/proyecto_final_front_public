              <p>
                We‚Äôre just five people who met while doing the same full-stack
                programming bootcamp. It was intense, fun, stressful, and
                honestly one of the best decisions we‚Äôve made. At first, we were
                just a bunch of strangers trying to figure out what all these
                weird code errors meant. But somewhere between the late-night
                coding sessions, the ‚Äúwait‚Ä¶ why isn‚Äôt this working?‚Äù meltdowns,
                and the little celebrations when it finally did, we went from
                classmates to friends, and from friends to a real team. We‚Äôve
                seen each other at our most frustrated and at our happiest, and
                somehow we‚Äôve survived it all with a sense of humor still
                intact.
              </p>
              <p>
                This e-commerce site is what came out of that whole adventure.
                We planned it, designed it, built it, broke it, fixed it, broke
                it again, and then fixed it for real (we hope). Along the way,
                we learned more than we expected ‚Äî not just about coding, but
                about patience, problem-solving, and how much better things go
                when you have people who‚Äôve got your back. It‚Äôs not perfect, but
                it‚Äôs ours, and we‚Äôre proud of every line of code in it. Thanks
                for checking it out ‚Äî it honestly means a lot to us that you‚Äôre
                here.

              <h3 className="text-center">Our mission</h3>
              <p>
                Our goal is pretty simple: make a site that‚Äôs easy to use and
                does what you need it to do without giving you a headache. We
                wanted it to feel smooth, elegant, clear, and friendly, so you
                don‚Äôt have to think about the tech behind it ‚Äî you just use it
                and it works. No overcomplicated menus, no unnecessary steps,
                and definitely no confusing buttons that make you wonder what
                you just clicked.
              </p>
              <p>
                We‚Äôre not some big company; we‚Äôre just a group of people who
                like building things and making them better. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôve
                paid attention to every little detail we could, from how the
                pages load to how things look on your phone. Whether you‚Äôre here
                to buy something specific or just to have a browse, we hope you
                enjoy the experience. This project is a mix of a lot of work, a
                lot of coffee, and a lot of laughs ‚Äî and now we get to share it
                with you, which makes it all worth it.
